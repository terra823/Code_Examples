To whom it may concern,

If you're reading this you are the one reviewing my programing abilities for a job I have applied to. I can already tell we will be great allies. 

Here are somethings you should know:

These samples are just that, samples. In this folder you will not find any production worthy projects, but rather simple instances where code typically, JS & PHP are correctly and neatly implemented. I take commenting and being neat very seriously in my work. At the time these projects were made, they all passed the W3 test with no errors. 

If you wish to see some of my production worthy work, visit my website: anthony-terruso.com.

If you like, you can also request a more specific code example, I also work with Python, ActionScript, and C++.

I am up for tests and hackathons. 


Best wishes,

-Anthony
